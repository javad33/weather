Wait, let me reconsider. The modified files are only `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` - these are all source code files. There are no build artifacts, dependency directories, or temporary files in the change list that would require adding ignore rules.

Since the changes only include source code and config files (HTML, JS, CSS) and no build artifacts or dependencies, the optimized .gitignore should be empty.

```gitignore
